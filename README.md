## Complexity of Balanced Bracket

Based on my analysis, the score of complexity of my code is low and ease of maintance.

- Cyclomatic Complexity 

  The function consists of a single loop with no nested loops or conditionals. Therefore, its cyclomatic complexity is relatively low.

- Cognitive Complexity 

  The cognitive complexity of the function is also relatively low. It contains straightforward logic without deeply nested conditionals or complex control flow.

- Maintainability 

  Based on the low cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, the function should be easy to maintain and understand.
